This is an altium footprint and 3d model for potentiometer similar to the RK097111T, but slightly different in pin size and thread.  I found it on Aliexpress, it's very popular there. Check Grabcad page for more info. https://grabcad.com/library/rk097-telescopic-shaft-kind-of-like-rk097111t-read-description-1
